## First priorities
- Create temples for _Terra Magna_ civs
	- Create hunter/herder temple for Xiongnu in place of fertility temple
- Create temples for _Millennium A.D._ civs
	- Create unique mosque temple for Umayyads. Should respect Islamic teachings about monotheism, replacing 3+ temples with one temple providing either some combination of the standard auras or a unique set of auras.
- Choose specific names for Persian, Carthaginian merchant temples

## Secondary priorities
- Create unique structure artwork for special temples.
- Integrate special temple building into Petra Bot

## General priorities
